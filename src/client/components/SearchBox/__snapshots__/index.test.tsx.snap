exports[`SearchBox Component should render <SearchBox /> 1`] = `
<div
  className="sc-bwzfXH glFDba"

  <input

    This search is case sensitive
  </div>
  <div>
    NOTE: The pagination is actually working. But since there are only 5 unique items and the other 25 are repeated it seems like the pagination does not work. You can test this out by changing the \`defaultPageSize\` prop in \`src/client/components/SearchBox/index.tsx\` to an odd number like 7. OR. even just select show \`20 rows\` and click the next button.
